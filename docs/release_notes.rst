Release notes
=============

Complete release notes can be found in the project's
`GitHub releases page`_.

Anymail practices `semantic versioning <semver>`_.
Among other things, this means that minor updates
(1.x to 1.y) should always be backwards-compatible,
and breaking changes will always increment the
major version number (1.x to 2.0).
