Release notes
=============

Complete release notes can be found in the project's
`GitHub releases page`_.

Anymail practices `semantic versioning <semver>`_.
Among other things, this means that minor updates
(1.x to 1.y) should always be backwards-compatible,
and breaking changes will always increment the
major version number (1.x to 2.0).

.. rubric:: PRE-1.0 DEVELOPMENT VERSIONS

Anymail is under active, early development right now.
Prior to a 1.0 alpha, features and APIs may change
rapidly. (Per semver, the 0.x minor version will get
bumped for any breaking changes before 1.0.)
